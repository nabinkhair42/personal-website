## Introduction

Writing code on regular IDEs like VSCode, IntelliJ, etc. is a great experience. But in the last few years, AI-powered IDEs have gained popularity among developers. VSCode introduced Copilot, marking the beginning of AI-powered IDEs. However, many other AI-powered IDEs like Trae, Cursor, Windsurf, and Pear support **Agentic coding**, assisting developers just like an AI-powered assistant that can write code, fix bugs, and suggest improvements.

## The Race of AI-Powered IDEs

Initially, Copilot from VSCode had limitations, but over time, it has significantly improved and is now an excellent tool for writing code. However, many other AI-powered IDEs like **Trae, Cursor, Windsurf, and Pear** also support **Agentic coding**. These IDEs utilize similar large language models (LLMs) such as **GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude 3.5, Claude 3.7, and DeepSeek Coder**.

Among these LLMs, Claude 3.5 was one of the most efficient models for generating high-quality code. However, with the recent release of Claude 3.7, developers now have access to an even more advanced and efficient model. Apart from Claude models, OpenAI's and DeepSeek's models are also widely used in various AI-powered IDEs.

## Exploring AI-Powered IDEs

Let's explore four leading AI-powered IDEs that are transforming the development landscape. Each offers unique features and capabilities to enhance the coding experience.

- **AI-generated test cases** to improve software reliability.
- **Intelligent project management** with predictive analytics.
- **Voice-controlled coding environments** for hands-free development.

AI-powered IDEs are not replacing developers but empowering them to write better code, faster. As these tools evolve, they will become an essential part of modern software development.

## Conclusion

AI-powered IDEs like **Trae, Cursor, Windsurf, and Pear** are revolutionizing the way developers write code. They offer smarter suggestions, automate tedious tasks, and enhance productivity.
