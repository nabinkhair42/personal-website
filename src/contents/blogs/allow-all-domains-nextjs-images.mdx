## Introduction

When using the `Image` component in Next.js to load images from external URLs, you must configure your project to allow these domains. This step ensures secure handling of remote images while optimizing performance. In this guide, we’ll explore how to allow custom domains and all domains for external images in Next.js.

## Allowing a Custom Domain

To allow images from a specific domain (e.g., `images.unsplash.com`), follow these steps:

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Update next.config.js">
    Open your `next.config.js` file and add the following configuration:
    ```javascript:next.config.ts showLineNumbers {2-9}
    module.exports = {
      images: {
        remotePatterns: [
          {
            protocol: 'https',
            hostname: 'images.unsplash.com',
          },
        ],
      },
    };
    ```
  </StepperItem>

<StepperItem title="Step 2: Restart the Development Server">
  After saving your changes, restart the server: ```bash npm run dev ```
</StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Verify the Configuration">
    Load your application and check that external images from the configured domain are displaying correctly.
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

<Note type="danger" title="Common Error">
  If you encounter an error, ensure that you’ve used `hostname` instead of
  `host`. This is a common mistake that can prevent the configuration from
  working.
</Note>

## Allowing All Domains

If your application needs to support images from any domain, you can use a wildcard configuration. This approach is less secure but useful for testing or handling dynamic domains.

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Modify next.config.js">
    Update your `next.config.js` file to include the following wildcard configuration:
    ```javascript:next.config.ts showLineNumbers {5-6}
    module.exports = {
      images: {
        remotePatterns: [
          {
            protocol: 'https',
            hostname: '**',
          },
        ],
      },
    };
    ```
  </StepperItem>

<StepperItem title="Step 2: Restart the Development Server">
  Save the file and restart the server to apply the changes: ```bash npm run dev
  ```
</StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Test the Setup">
    Load your application and verify that images from any secure domain are displaying correctly.
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

<Note type="warning" title="Pro Tip">
  Use this configuration only when absolutely necessary, as it is less secure
  than specifying individual domains. Always restart the development server
  after changing `next.config.js` to ensure the updates take effect.
</Note>

## Conclusion

Configuring image domains in Next.js is essential for secure and efficient handling of external images. By specifying trusted domains or using a wildcard for all domains, you can customize your application’s image-handling capabilities.

<Note type="success" title="Key Takeaway">
  While allowing specific domains is recommended for most scenarios, enabling
  all domains can be useful during development or for specific use cases. Tailor
  your configuration to your project’s needs for optimal results.
</Note>

By following this guide, you can ensure seamless integration of external images in your Next.js applications.
