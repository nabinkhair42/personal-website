I'm excited to share [Snip UI](https://github.com/nabinkhair42/snip) with you â€“ a project I've built to make interacting with locally hosted Large Language Models as seamless as using ChatGPT. It's an open-source chat app that brings professional-grade features while keeping your data completely private and secure.

<Note type="success" title="What Makes Snip Special">
  Snip is designed with **privacy-first architecture** - all processing happens
  locally on your machine, giving you complete control over your AI
  interactions.
</Note>

## Why I Built Snip UI

I wanted to create a solution that bridges the gap between powerful local LLMs and everyday users. Whether you're running models through **LM Studio** or other local setups, **Snip UI** provides the polished, intuitive interface you deserve.

## Core Features

    Real-time chat interactions
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Modern User Experience">

## Getting Started with Snip

I have made entire step by step guide to get started with Snip. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/nabinkhair42/snip/blob/main/README.md)

## Who Will Find Snip UI Useful?

I built Snip UI for anyone who wants to:

- Keep their **AI conversations** private and secure
- Run language models locally without cloud dependencies
- Have a professional chat interface without the enterprise price tag
- Experiment with different local AI models

<Note type="warning" title="System Requirements">
  While Snip is optimized for performance, you'll need appropriate hardware to
  run your chosen language model locally.
</Note>

## Future Development

I'm actively working on Snip UI and plan to add:

- Code Snippet support
- Supporting models that are running via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).
- Performance optimizations
