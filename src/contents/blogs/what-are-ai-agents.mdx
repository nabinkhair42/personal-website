AI agents are AI-powered systems that have access to their environments and are capable of performing tasks automatically without human intervention. These agents heavily rely on machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret and understand their surroundings.

### Why Agents?

We've seen AI-based chat services like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. While these systems understand context and provide information based on their training, they lack real-time data processing and the ability to perform actions. This is where AI agents come into play. An agent can perform actions based on the environment and context it operates in, using predefined instructions and real-time data.

### How AI Agents Work

  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Define the Context and Data Collection">
    AI agents begin by understanding the environment they operate in and gathering relevant data.

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Making Decisions">
    Based on the collected data and predefined instructions, agents analyze the context to make informed decisions.

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Performing Actions">
    Once a decision is made, the agent executes the necessary actions autonomously.

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Learning and Improving">
    Over time, AI agents learn from their experiences, refining their processes to enhance performance and adapt to new challenges.

### Real-World Applications

AI agents are already being integrated into numerous sectors:

1. **Customer Service**: Automating responses and managing inquiries without human intervention.
2. **Finance**: Conducting transactions, analyzing market trends, and detecting fraud.
3. **Logistics**: Optimizing supply chain management by autonomously negotiating with suppliers and managing deliveries.
4. **Creative Assistance**: Tools like GitHub Copilot help developers by suggesting code snippets based on context.


<Note type="success" title="Fact">
  In 2025, AI agents will be used in more and more applications, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.
