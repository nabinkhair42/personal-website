AI agents are AI-powered systems that have access to their environments and are capable of performing tasks automatically without human intervention. These agents heavily rely on machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret and understand their surroundings.

### Why Agents?

We've seen AI-based chat services like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. While these systems understand context and provide information based on their training, they lack real-time data processing and the ability to perform actions. This is where AI agents come into play. An agent can perform actions based on the environment and context it operates in, using predefined instructions and real-time data.

### How AI Agents Work

  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Define the Context and Data Collection">
    AI agents begin by understanding the environment they operate in and gathering relevant data.

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Making Decisions">
    Based on the collected data and predefined instructions, agents analyze the context to make informed decisions.

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Performing Actions">
    While building the agent the developer have defined some of the functions that are capable of accessing read and write properties in the database or any thing as the agent has the access to the machine. Now the agent get the proper action path from the AI model with the help of realtime data and implement the task with the help of the predefined functions.

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Learning and Improving">
    The continous interaction with the agent along with the functions, data and environments, the agent is now capable of learning from the previous communication and the task history and perform the better and new action in the new task that will be given to the agent in future. a

### Real-World Applications

AI agents are already being integrated into numerous sectors:

1. **Customer Service**: Automating responses and managing inquiries without human intervention.
2. **Finance**: Conducting transactions, analyzing market trends, and detecting fraud.
3. **Logistics**: Optimizing supply chain management by autonomously negotiating with suppliers and managing deliveries.
4. **Creative Assistance**: Tools like GitHub Copilot help developers by suggesting code snippets based on context.


<Note type="success" title="Fact">
  In 2025, AI agents will be used in more and more applications, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.
